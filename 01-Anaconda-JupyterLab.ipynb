    "# Installing and Using Anaconda/Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "## What/Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda (the company) has a variety of products, some open source and others closed source.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are interested in Anaconda the Python environment management tool (one of Anaconda's earlier projects and still a key part of their offering).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda will allow us to easily\n",
    "* Manage different environments for our different Python projects\n",
    "    * including different version of Python\n",
    "    * different sets of dependencies\n",
    "* Retrieve relevant versions of Python ecosystem tools\n",
    "* Avoid and/or resolve version and dependency conflicts when we need to change or upgrade packages\n",
    "* Provide/share environment descriptions with our co-workers so that we are all running the same environment\n",
    "    * Less \"it works on my machine\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You're actually using an Anaconda (\"conda\" for short) environment right now! Look in `binder/environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few Anaconda-related tools: we're going to focus on a slimmed-down tool called \"Miniconda\" and our first demos and hands-on exercise will be installing Miniconda and creating an environment from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why?__ This notebook environment is nice, and you said we were already running a conda env?!\n",
    "\n",
    "When folks start out working with Python, the setup process for conda and JupyterLab (our notebook environment) can be a little mysterious. We're going to remove all the mystery so that everyone is comfortable installing and using these tools wherever they're needed."

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions are for your reference now and in the future -- but they are the one project we'll do that cannot run in this present JupyterLab setup. Why? Because we want to practice configuring the tool that lies __underneath__ the JupyterLab we're running. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we're going to \"borrow\" a clean VM to work on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Install Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a new browser at: https://www.katacoda.com/scenario-examples/courses/environment-usages/ubuntu-2004\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You're root. But often, you won't be, and conda doesn't require root. Make a new user called demo by running `adduser demo`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Become demo: `su demo` and go home `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Download Miniconda: `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make the Miniconda script executable: `chmod a+x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Run the script (`./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`) and work through the install prompts. Choose __yes__ for the install location and for initializing Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, conda is mostly set up ... but the current shell didn't start with the conda helper shortcuts. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Start a new shell: `bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Type `conda` and you should now see a help message. That's success!"
